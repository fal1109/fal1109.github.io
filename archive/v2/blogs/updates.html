            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(04/11/24)welcome to the new layout, im still working on my website, theres gonna be some placeholder text here and there </h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(6/11/24)that button you see was supposed to be a part of my website[or atleast it's function was supposed to], but neocities doesnt allow api fetching for free users. im going to finish this site locally and push it to a domain ill buy in future. for now this is what its gonna be.</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(9/11/24)makeshift solution to previous issue; using iframe for my discord presence instead, kinda sticks out like a sore thumb sadly. heres the <a href="https://lanyard-visualizer.netlify.app/">source</a>. ah i also removed the button too. learnt a bit of flexboxing to move the links to the right</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(10/11/24)centered the website, then the iframe looked not-centered. so i threw that in a box[couldnt figure out the fix]. thank you to the tetrio discord community for helping me on this. changed the bg to a bit darker now, might change it later</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(14/11/2024)added space for my devices, thinking about the layout</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(16/11/2024) added devices, still under construction</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(17/11/2024) discord added, finished devices. made a button as well, pretty bad tho, so it might change later on. added blog space</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(18/11/2024) added gif behind first box thing</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(30/12/2024) a to-do list. dont know if ill add anything, happy 2025</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(08/02/2025) changed endeavour to arch linux</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(23/03/2025) moving completely to github as i can do api fetching. added music activity, remade the whole blogpost css to be more simpler.</h5>
            <h5 class='oxygen-regular'>(24/03/2025) added activity for other stuff like games, code etc.</h5>
